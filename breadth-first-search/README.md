# Breadth First Search Project

This project implements a single iteration of bfs to simulate connecting electronic components in an integrated circuit. 
The code takes in 4 input files: input 1 contains our starting nodes, input 2 contains the neighbours of the nodes in input 1, input 3 contains some information on each gate such as 
whether it has been visited, the gate type, the input, and the output (if the gate has been visited). Input 4 contains the list of nodes in our queue.
